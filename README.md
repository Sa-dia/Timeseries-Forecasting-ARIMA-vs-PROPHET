# üìà Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA vs PROPHET

This repository demonstrates **time series forecasting** using two popular models: **ARIMA** and **PROPHET**.  
It also includes a comparison between the two approaches based on forecasting accuracy.

## üìù Project Overview

**Objective:**  
- Predict future values of a time series dataset.  
- Compare the performance of **ARIMA** and **PROPHET** models.  

**Models Used:**  
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A classical statistical method for time series forecasting.  
- **PROPHET**: A machine learning-based model developed by Facebook for forecasting time series with seasonality and trends.
